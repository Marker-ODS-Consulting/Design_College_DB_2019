> Once we have received your application, you will be notified by email where you will either be requested to bring your portfolio to an interview OR you will be instructed how to upload your online portfolio.  
> If you are applying direct from studying A-levels, we recommend you develop a separate personal portfolio along side your coursework portfolio. This can include your own experiments in design, making, photography and drawing. We are interested in seeing all the stages of your working process from where the initial idea came, how they were developed and prototyped for the finished design.
> We look for evidence of the following within a strong portfolio:  

Creativity
> - Early sketch models and prototypes that illustrated your thinking.
> - Evidence of the creative leaps that informed your final solution.
> - Drawing and presentation skills
> - Basic evidence of hand drawing, sketching and rendering. How you visually communicate and present your ideas, either as flatwork drawings or digitally.  

Design skills and ideas
> Your understanding of aesthetics, shape and form. Your knowledge of materials and manufacturing methods related to your designs. The quantity of ideas generated and the intellectual thinking behind your work.

Making and prototyping
> - Evidence of iterative prototyping, practical skills and three-dimensional working. Your selection and experimentation of materials.

Digital skills  
> - Not essential, but useful to understand what basic software packages you use.

Knowledge of the design market
> - Why you wish to study design to degree level and your ambitions and future intensions. The research methods used to inform your ideas.

Sketchbooks
> - We enjoy seeing raw ideas and sketch work from your sketchbook, all your doodles drawings and thumbnail sketches.

Portfolio submissions
> - If you are instructed to upload an online portfolio, your portfolio can be via PDF, PowerPoint or Flickr.

### 2. 马克君翻译与解读：

##### 硬性要求提取：
- PDF 或 PPT 或 Flickr网站链接。  
- 如果在英国面对面面试，必须携带打印版作品集。  

##### 软性要求解读：
- 学校要求比较具体，甚至说到了模型制作和手绘本(sketchbook)这些本科学生才具备的技能。所以，建议学生多使用 sketchbook 表达设计概念的发展和演化，作品集可以基于 sketchbook 的扫描与电子化再创作。  
- 同时，由于专业名带有“家具”设计，所以可以在这方面做些尝试。
