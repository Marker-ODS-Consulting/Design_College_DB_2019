-Applicants to Art, Design and Fine Art programmes will be asked to submit a digital mini portfolio.  

> Assessment of the mini-portfolio will form part of the selection process. Applicants applying to enter Year 2 of our programmes, who pass the first stage of selection, will be invited to bring a full portfolio to an applicant day.  

> Mini-portfolio allows applicants to Art and Design undergraduate programmes at Edinburgh College of Art to submit supplementary visual evidence to support their application(s).

How your portfolio will be assessed by the Edinburgh College of Art？

> Your mini-portfolio will be assessed by a team of Edinburgh College of Art academic staff with professional and specialist expertise in art & design. The assessment panel are particularly interested in how applicants researched and developed their ideas in a visual way and how they engage with the visual arts and their imaginative and creative responses to ideas, to observations, to processes and to concepts. This is broken down into four main areas of assessment.  

Enquiry and Visual Research  

> The level of your engagement in intelligent, structured visual enquiry and how well you communicate this.  

Idea Development and Material/Technical Exploration  

> Your ability to explore and develop ideas in an appropriate way, and your level of skill in the use of materials and techniques.  

Critical Judgement, Selection and Resolution  
> How well you judge which ideas have the most appropriate potential and your ability to bring them to a level of completion appropriate to your intended outcome.  

Contextual Awareness  

> - The extent of your knowledge of the subject you have applied for and how your work relates to it.
> - Looking at the assessment areas, your portfolio will need to include initial research/investigative work and examples of how you explore ideas, as well as examples of finished work. What form these examples might take is entirely up to you, but they must be relevant to the degree programme you are applying to. On the whole, greater emphasis is put on evidence of your visual curiosity, idea generation and exploration, and your energy, engagement and contextual awareness, than on high level technical skills and finish.
> - At this initial stage, the University is not necessarily expecting a showcase of final work, but rather an indication of work in progress. This must demonstrate how you approach an idea or subject and then develop the work from initial enquiry, through experimentation and enquiry, to resolved work.

##### 硬性要求提取：
- 无。

##### 软性要求解读：
- 虽然是申请本科，但是爱丁堡对于学生“意识”层面理解的要求还是很高的，关键词里提到了设计表现、概念发展、材料和工艺、批判思维甚至是设计语境的理解。所以建议学生不仅要凭借热情和想法进行手绘，最好能够读一些基础设计书籍或上一些设计课，才能够让作品集踩到得分点，增强竞争力。
