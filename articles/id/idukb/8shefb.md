> For the selection event, you should bring a portfolio containing examples of your work. We ask for this to understand your creative experience and potential ability. It should evidence your interests in your creative specialism to date. This may include past and current school or college work, other personal projects, work in progress and other work that you feel demonstrates your creative potential.  

What should be in my portfolio?
> - including any work you have done outside of school or college. We do not look for highly finished professional work, but we want to see imagination, enthusiasm and a confident visual style. The portfolio should include some or all of the following. 
> - A range of drawing skills. Many different types of drawing can be relevant.
> - 3D work and making things in materials such as wood, metal, plastic, card, fabric – or good quality photographs of the work if it is not practical to take with you.
> - Art, graphics or photography work.
> - Anything you have made, drawn or produced that enables you to express your creative potential. It’s fine to do extra work if you feel that your portfolio is missing something.
> - If school or college work is likely to be sent away for assessment or put on display, keep copies so that you can still include good work in your portfolio.

How should I organise my portfolio?
> We will only have a short time to review your portfolio. The important thing is to assemble a lively collection that shows both the breadth and depth of your work. Organise your portfolio as a set of projects or activities. Put them in an order that seems to make sense – it doesn’t have to be in the order in which the work was done. You don’t have to include every bit of work you’ve done. Be selective, but not too selective. Include the development process, not just the finished work.

Portfolio commentary
> Put your name on your portfolio, clearly but sensitively. Add a short explanatory title (one or two sentences) at the start of each piece of work saying what it is, what it’s about and when it was done. This will help to ensure that your portfolio is understood when you are not there to explain it.

### 2. 马克君翻译与解读：

##### 硬性要求提取：
- 无。

##### 软性要求解读：
- 学校明确说：不需要专业度，也不需要太多项目。简单清晰地表达清楚项目思路，过程和内在的逻辑即可。不需要面向工业设计，各个方向只有有一些相关性都可以。
