### 2. 马克君翻译与解读：

##### 硬性要求提取：
- 至少10个项目  
- 10个项目的类型和复杂度可以不同  


##### 软性要求解读：
- 学校给出了一个可能的项目分类：Research project; Designed object/artifact; Craft/hack/mod; Business venture; Conceptual work; Published work; Pro-bono initiatives; Competition entries. 但是这个包罗万象，几乎不能够成为一个选题参考，简单来说可以理解为学校希望看到各种类型的各种项目，但是一定要强调问题的发现与解决。
- 真实性很重要，失败的尝试、坏了的模型这种贵在真实的东西是学校希望看到的。
