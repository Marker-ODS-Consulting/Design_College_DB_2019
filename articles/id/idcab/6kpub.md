> Between 8-10 examples of varied work is sufficient for your application, and all that can be presented during a 30-minute interview  
> - You can include such items as drawings, illustrations, posters, typography, computer graphics, animation, video, paintings, printmaking, photography, drafting, crafts, sewn garments, and three-dimensional pieces.
> - Some of our students come from engineering, science, trades or technical programs and include projects showcasing programming, building or design skills.
> - A journal, sketchbook, collections of ideas, or process documentation for a project will help to demonstrate your thinking processes.
> - As you select work for presentation, keep in mind that we are interested in seeing what you consider to be your best work, demonstrating your skills and abilities. A wide range of varied items is better than several of the same kind of work. As a designer you will be expected to work on a wide repertoire of tasks, so you need to show versatility.
> - Also, if you can, include one project that shows how you began (e.g. research, notes, early sketches), through to development stages (revisions and tests), and then the final result. Design typically involves taking projects through several stages before completion.
> - Make sure that your work is logically organized. We want to understand your projects: explanations of what you were trying to achieve, dates, sizes, medium, whether school work or done in your own time.
> ##### Acceptable Formats for your Portfolio  
> Portfolios can take many acceptable forms. They can be: original pieces, printed reproductions, or digital files.
> - Digital (e.g. on CD, DVD, USB Drive, or Website URL);
> - Hardcopy (e.g. zipper cases with work inserted into plastic sleeves or mounted on matte board, or work presented in customized containers);
> - Audio-Visual (e.g. photographs, video, animation);
> - Original pieces (e.g. physical 3D pieces or prototypes).
