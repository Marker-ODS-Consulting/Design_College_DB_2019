> Your portfolio is a collection of work and ideas that demonstrate the state of your creative development. We want to see what you create to imagine how you might succeed at Emily Carr University of Art + Design. A strong portfolio includes a diverse array of artwork, experimental processes, material techniques, observation skills, and creative thinking. There is no rigid or fail-safe formula for a good portfolio: we are looking for that unique combination of creativity, engagement, and inspiration that makes art, design, and media education suitable for you.
> #### Part 1: Examples of your Creative Practice
- We are interested in seeing a wide range of examples of your creative practice. We encourage you to submit not only visual arts projects, but also sound, time-based, craft-based, design, 3D, illustration, and animation work. All media, mixed or otherwise - from a video or a song, to a comic strip or a zine - are welcome. Please submit only your best work in its final state from the last two years.
- We will only evaluate 10 samples maximum. We are asking that you be critical in your selection.  

> #### Part 2: Process Projects
We want to know how you create, how you problem-solve, how you ask questions, and where your process takes you. Please respond to all the prompts provided below by submitting 1 image (or one 20-second video) per prompt. Be sure to label your slide with the relevant prompt and feel free to add a title should you feel so inspired.
- 1.What keeps you up at night?
- 2.Describe where you live without showing any images of your home.
- 3.You have been asked to design a town square; what would you put in the centre of it?
- After responding to the three prompts artistically, please tell us how you feel about that entire creative process by writing no more than 50 words.  

> #### Part 3: Written Responses
Respond to the following three questions. We want to hear your voice and learn about you through your writing. This is not a formal essay, but an opportunity for personal reflection and intellectual honesty. Please keep your answers to 75 - 100 words each.
- 1.What makes a problem interesting to you?
- 2.Make a list of all the things you’d like to learn at Emily Carr.
- 3.If you could change one thing in the world, what would it be?

### 2. 马克君翻译与解读：

##### 硬性要求提取：
长而具体，我们一一来说：

- 第一部分：创意项目  
放10个项目（10页内容），以代表自己的创意设计能力。

- 第二部分：过程项目  
根据三个提示，分别做三个小项目，或者20秒小视频
  - 你为何失眠
  - 描述你的家乡，但不要出现家乡的图片
  - 如果让你设计一个镇子的中心广场，你会放什么。  

  第二部分的要求是完全开放主体的，学校希望看到的是创意性的思维。完成后，每个主体写50字的设计感受。

- 第三部分：文字回复
  - 遇到的“问题（指的是设计中的问题）”哪里让你感兴趣
  - 你希望在艾米丽卡尔学什么
  - 如果你能够改变世界的一个“thing”，你希望改变什么？  

  不需要正式的学术书写，简单回答即可，每个回答75-100字。

##### 软性要求解读：
毕竟是纯艺术类院校，艾米丽卡尔的作品集要求非常详细，而且也有一定难度，认真构思自己的想法，真实表达自己创意。提交之前，再确认一下提交的格式即可。
