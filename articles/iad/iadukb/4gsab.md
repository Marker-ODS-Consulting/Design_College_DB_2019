> -	We are interested in the concepts and ideas behind your work how and how they progress and develop; from the initial starting point / source of inspiration through to a finished piece of work.
>
- This could be evidenced by uploading photographs of sketchbook pages / notebooks / worksheets / development sheets and also finished pieces. The work presented should be mainly visual, you will have a chance to explain your process and ideas in the Supporting Text (more details provided on what to include in the following slides).
>
- We want to see your practical skills and how you explore and use different media and materials: This could be demonstrated in a variety of ways including drawing / painting (analytical / abstract), 2D/3D work, photography / CAD etc. This could be evidenced by uploading photographs of your sketchbooks, development work, preparatory sketches and final pieces. Several smaller images could be grouped together together in one slide, but ensure you are happy with the level of detail you can see.
>
- At least 5 of the 15 images uploaded should show development work i.e. sketchbook pages or development sheets. These should be mainly made up of your own work, we do not want to see lots of secondary source material (magazine cut outs, print outs from the internet, photocopies from books). The remaining 10 images should show a range of work and your abilities and interests; these images may include work in progress, sketchbook pages or final pieces of work. These images, again, should be mainly made up of your own work, we do not want to see lots of secondary source material. You should also include some independently generated work, i.e. self-directed work which you produce outwith your current school /college /other course curriculum which demonstrates your own personal interests

### 2. 马克君翻译与解读：

##### 硬性要求提取：
- 至少有5页内容是草图或者是发展过程
- 剩下10页展示你的作品，同时展现出你的能力以及兴趣爱好
- 作品全部由自己独立完成


##### 软性要求解读：
- 学校希望从你的作品集中看到你每一个作品集背后概念或者想法是如何产生，发展并用到你的作品中的。同时他们还想看到你不同的实践技巧以及使用不同的材料和媒介去完成不同类型的作品。这里我建议作品类型应该包括手绘，手工作品（三维），以及电脑作图。 最后，建议作品集中不要出现太多从网上或者其他地方找来的现成的内容，即使是调研，也不要照搬别人的内容。
