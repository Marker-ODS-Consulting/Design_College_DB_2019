> Content
> 
- Include relevant work related to the subject area. Know about the course you are applying for. You may like to view some of the student work on our website. Show ideas generation, experimentation and risk taking.
- Think about the basics   
Show examples of paintings, drawings, photographs, three-dimensional work, time-based work and anything else relevant to the area of practice. 
- Tell a story   
Try to show one full project from start to finish with the preparatory drawings included. Annotations are helpful as they show how you research and reflect on the development of your work. See here for examples of good ways to evidence ‘’design process’’. See Tatiana Pachina and Roxana Cislariu's portfolios as examples
- The Finished Article  
Include three to four final pieces that you are able to talk about. This might include photographs of physical models or images generated from digital 3D models
- The Sketchbook   
Include extracts from sketchbooks to help us understand how you think (through your annotations) and allow us to see the development of your drawing. You may wish to photograph or scan some of the best pages from your sketchbook.

> Final word of advice
> 
- What is the first thing that we will see in your portfolio? This should grab our attention. What will be the mid-point highlight? What will you end with? Consider the flow of your portfolio - this will help keep viewers interested. Also, can you say your portfolio communicated with passion?
