What should be in my portfolio?
>
Confident visual style  
>
- Your portfolio must provide a clear view of your creative potential and of work that you have done. We do not look for highly finished professional work as much as imagination, enthusiasm and a confident visual style. You may not have done any interior design projects, but the work you show us should demonstrate a strong interest and ability in both two and three dimensional areas.   
>
Drawing skills and 3D work
>
- We are very interested in seeing your drawing skills. Life drawings give a good idea of your potential. We also like to see 3D work. If you have 3D work that is too big to bring along, please make sure you include some good quality photographs. Even if your college or school has limited workshop facilities, you can still produce worthwhile 3D work. Some of the most interesting 3D projects use very basic studio materials such as card or fabric.  
>
Creativity  
>
- Don’t confine your portfolio just to design work. We also like to see examples of other creative work or personal interests which might be relevant. It’s appropriate to include work from art or photography and maybe from other subjects. We encourage you to include anything that you have made, drawn or produced that enables you to express your creative potential.
>
How should I organise my portfolio?
>
Breadth and depth
>
- When compiling your portfolio, remember that we will only have a short time to look at it. The important thing is to put together a lively collection that shows both the breadth and depth of your work and how your abilities have developed.  
>
Prepare yourself, make notes
>
- It’s much easier if you prepare. Don’t rehearse a speech – it’s best to be yourself. Think about what you want to say. If you wish to make a few notes to remind you about points you want to make or a list of questions that you want to ask, that’s fine. Don’t forget to include your name on your portfolio, clearly but sensitively.
Portfolio commentary  
>
- It’s a good idea to ensure that each piece of work has a short explanatory title. One or two sentences should be sufficient. Your portfolio may be seen by someone when you are not there to explain it and this will help to make sure that it is not misunderstood.

##### 硬性要求提取：
- 无


##### 软性要求解读：
学校从两大方面给出了建议，一是作品集内容，二是作品集的版面。

内容方面：

- 不需要有很专业的设计作品，重要的是从你的作品中看到你的潜力，你的创造力  
- 绘画技巧的展示和三维作品的制作
- 创造力，不要把你的作品仅限于做设计，其他有想法的形式的作品都是可以的

版面方面：

- 学校没有过多的时间去很细致的阅读你的作品集，所以你要合适的安排你的作品集内容，尽可能展示出你的作品的深度和你的能力
- 每个作品做好都配合上一些文字去解释说明
