>- We like to see sketches and the kind of research you do. We are interested to see how you have taken something you have researched and turned it into an idea. We also like to see finished pieces, so you could include things you have put in for an exam. If you have big models or installations, the best thing to do is to photograph them giving some sense of scale.

>- It is important that we see evidence of spatial thinking. This might be drawings you have made of buildings, or spaces that you have visited. They may be drawings of models, or life drawing classes that you may have been to.

>- We are not particularly interested in CAD drawings or attempts to do architectural drawings, because you will be learning how to do these on the course.

>- If you are organising a Flickr portfolio, think about ordering your work thematically, so include preparatory sketches and final work together. You might want to include some text or words to explain what you have been doing, or the project title.

>- We will assess the work against three measures: the level of inventiveness that you have been using in developing the work, your drawing skills, and the range of media that you have been using.

内容方面应该注重以下几点：

- 有足够的草图和不同的调研内容
- 能够展现出你对空间的思考能力，比如你画的建筑或者你曾经去过的任何空间
- 不需要有专业的建筑制图等专业方面的内容
- 不仅展现出你作品的最终结果，还要配合上你的草图以及一定的文字加以描述
- 创造力，手绘技巧，各种不同媒介的使用。这里建议不要只有手绘的作品，还要有手工等其他形式的作品
