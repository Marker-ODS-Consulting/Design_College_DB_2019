> -	Your portfolio should feature examples of research and the development of your ideas and projects – this should be highly presentable and well organised. It may be useful to arrange your work into themes, styles or chronological order. This will demonstrate good organisational skills and your own artistic awareness.
> 
- It should exhibit your creative journey, thinking processes and individual personality, so we can assess your potential. It’s also important to show both your inspirations and aspirations, as your portfolio should say a lot about you and your creative identity, as well as the course you’re applying for.
>
- Documenting the development of your ideas in a sketchbook is a great way to show us how you approached the task of creating your work, allowing us to gain insight into your creative thought processes and approach to your subject, and demonstrating a clear rationale.
>
- Make sure your portfolio is well presented. Remember, our tutors will only have a short amount of time to look through each portfolio, so you need to organise your work intelligently. Put some of your most attention grabbing and interesting work at the front and lead the viewer through your journey by exhibiting pieces of work that showcase a variety of skills, materials, techniques and influences – this might include paintings, drawings, photography, digital pieces, storyboards, animation images or written work. And be sure to end your portfolio with the rest of your strongest work, so we’re left feeling excited about your talent. Highlight your favourite pieces too, and indicate what or who inspires you.

##### 硬性要求提取：
- 无


##### 软性要求解读：
- 学校希望从作品集中看到的是你的思考过程，概念的发展过程，个性，创造力及潜力。你的作品集内容都要围绕着这些来做，内容类型上没有太多要求。要求中还提出，画草图是最好的展现你思考过程的方法，所以显然你的作品集中要有足够多的草图。最后，你的作品在作品集中的呈现方式，排布顺序一定要合理，具有逻辑性，并且足够抓眼球，这样才能让审查作品集的老师在有限的时间内记住你。
