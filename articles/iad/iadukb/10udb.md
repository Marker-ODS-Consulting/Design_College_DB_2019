Digital Portfolio Content
>
- The main content of your portfolio will demonstrate aspects of your design process, a variation of the Design Council’s double diamond Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver.

- Make sure your images are clear, bright and a scale suitable to view online
- Use a typographic font that is legible for online viewing
>
Digital Portfolio Submission
>
- You will be prompted by our Admissions Team to submit your digital portfolio (and answer a few questions in respect of your interest in studying art & design at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art & Design), via the University of Dundee Applicant Portal, thereafter, if required, we may contact you to arrange an interview in person or via Skype.
>
Digital/Portfolio Guidelines
>
Within your portfolio submission, we would ask that you evidence work that connects with our core values.  
>
Our values emerge as themes through design practice: People, Place, Technology and Design. Ideally, we want to view your digital portfolio/read your supporting statement/question responses as if we are having a face-to-face conversation with you.
>
We want to know if you are comfortable with our values and share them.
>
We have prepared some probing questions connected to our three values and themes to encourage you to have a conversation with us while preparing your portfolio.
>
- From a People perspective, we all have different needs and we want to hear how you think your designs will make people’s lives better. Who would you like to design for? What problems did you notice that inspired you to redesign an existing product or devise a new one? What did you learn from prototyping and model-making? How did others respond to your designs? How did you resolve issues around form, aesthetics and ergonomics?
- From a Place perspective, what types of environments interest you in terms of places of work, home or play?  Which artists, designers, architects and mavericks do you admire? How do you generate ideas? Which creative processes and skills do you like to use to express your ideas (digital, hand-made etc.) How do you relate to people and places when you develop interior ideas 
- From a Design perspective, what designers or companies do you admire? Is there a period in design history that inspires you? What tools and techniques do you use in the design process that shows your skills? What aspects of the thinking and making process do you enjoy?
- From a Technology perspective, you need to think and plan how you tell your story: tell us how you perhaps use open source code or deconstruct your computer. Are there tech trends that interest you, screen designs, human interfaces or social networking platforms? Have you worked with materials, structures or electronics to develop designs? Explain why you love working with technology and what got you started.
