> -	The Purpose of a Portfolio:

The portfolio submission in extremely important in terms of your overall assessment. The purpose of the portfolio is to provide a sampling of your
best pieces of art/design demonstrating your conceptual, problem solving, technical skills and personality. Your portfolio will be reviewed and evaluated
by Interior Design faculty and will allow us to determine your suitability for the education available within the Interior Design program.
Applicants are encouraged to incorporate evaluation feedback and resubmit their portfolio a second time should they initially fail to meet the program’s
requirements.

What goes into an entrance Portfolio forthis program?

Candidates applying to the Interior Design program must include all of the elements listed on the following pages in their portfolio. This applies for digital and hard copy submissions.

a) 10-15 examples of your own work

Choose your best work that features your wide range of skills.
Some examples to include may be:

• Pencil and ink drawings
• Multimedia presentations
• Sketches of ongoing work showing your ideas, observations and imagination
• AutoCAD drawings
• Hand drafted architectural drawings
• Artistic Photography
• Graphic design
• 3D models

PLEASE NOTE: Each piece should be clearly labeled indicating the title and medium used.Any work that is 3-dimensional should be photographed.

b) Completed Home Test

The Home Test is comprised of two components. Clearly identify the home test component when you are labelling and organizing your portfolio.

1. A sequence or series of separate elements depicting a journey/story told in seven stages. The journey could be any kind of journey (e.g. narrative, imaginary, fictional or literal). Explore your creativity and concept work. If an explanation of your journey/story helps situate your piece then please include.

2. A hand pencil sketch of an interior public space. Be sure to include what is seen in both the foreground and the background of the space. Please select a public space where you can sit and create this sketch such as a shopping mall, library, coffee shop, school, museum, art gallery, etc. No samples of the home test are shown as we want you to use your creativity and we are looking to see your own interpretation.

c) A short essay of 300-500 words

The essay is a required element of your portfolio presentation. It is to be approximately 300-500 words that describe your interest and knowledge of Interior Design as a profession. Introduce yourself and explain why you wish to become a professional designer and how you have been influenced. Include any architectural/design influences, books, designers/architects (or their work), mentors who have infl uenced you, or any Interior Design projects that have inspired you.You might want to research on various Interior Design-related web sites such as ARIDO,IDC, IFI, CIDA or NCIDQ.

How to present your work:

A well-organized, well-executed presentation is extremely important. It is your only method of communicating who you are to us. Your work can be presented in a standard portfolio case or submitted online as a PDF. The size of the portfolio case and the PDF submission will depend upon the size of the work being presented but should be no larger than 11” x 17”. Be sure to organize your work into a cohesive presentation, labelling each item. This may be achieved by mounting all work on either landscape or portrait format stiff cardboard (black, white or grey) and by organizing it by category (ink drawings, pencil drawings, etc.) You should also label your work and include a very brief description if you think appropriate.
