> A portfolio is a collection of work which tells us about your creative and problem solving process, your drawing skills and how you present yourself as an artist and designer. The work you present is extremely important in your application. Your portfolio is reviewed by Interior Design faculty to determine your suitability for the program.

> Applicants must submit a portfolio that includes four creative pieces. Be sure to title each submission and briefly describe it (maximum 50 words for each piece).

> The requirements for these submissions are as follows:

> - Submission #1 – Perspective line drawing of a chair (two-point perspective). You may use your choice of medium for this piece, however, you are encouraged to work in black line for the chair and to use construction lines to show proper perspective methods. Include a small photograph of the chair you have drawn as part of the submission page.

> - Submission #2 – Perspective line drawing of an interior space or building façade. This should be from an actual space or building and not from your imagination or an abstract method. You may use your own choice of medium. Include a small photograph of the space or building you have drawn as part of the submission page.

> - Submission #3 – Colour still life study that demonstrates your use of colour and composition. You are encouraged to group everyday objects such as fruit, small appliances, pottery or shoes. We will assess your representation of realistic details: shade and shadow, depth, tonal value and texture. Include a small photograph of the object(s) you have drawn as part of the submission page.

> - Submission #4 – Compulsory Submission of Your Choice (one required submission)

> Please choose one of the following which you feel describes your work as a designer or artist:

> - a) Interior design work such as plan/section/elevation and materials board. This may be a school project or something you completed on your own;  
> - b) A sculpture or architectural model, or something you designed and fabricated including the conceptual sketches and the finished piece;  
> - c) AutoCAD, Sketchup or Revit drawings you feel show your talent as a designer;
