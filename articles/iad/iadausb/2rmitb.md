The pre-selection kit requires:
>
- an applicant statement outlining your interest in interior design (maximum 150 words)
- a statement describing your experience such as employment, voluntary work, etc., or a description of what you have done, over what periods and how it strengthens your application to this program (maximum 150 words)
- a 2 part Design exercise which provides an opportunity to communicate your creative thinking through an image and written responses. You should draw on your own experience, imagination and skills in putting forward a thoughtful and creative response of your own. There is no one correct response that we are looking for and we do not expect you to have any substantial prior knowledge of interior design. In this task we are looking for you to demonstrate a critical and considered understanding of your own work.

The image must be formatted as JPEG or PDF and must be no larger than 3MB or you may provide a URL to your single image if hosted online.
- Part 2: In no more than 300 words, discuss the thinking behind the creative piece you selected in Part 1 including the reasons why you selected it.
