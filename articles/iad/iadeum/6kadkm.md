>- For us to be able to assess your way of working from the beginning to final proposal it is required that you present this for at least three (3) of the works that you submit. You may, for example, present different types of sketches (some need to be made by hand), renderings, studies, photographs of models, models in context, films and/or other images that show how the final proposal evolved. Explain them with captions in which you describe, for instance, your starting point, intention, task and other aspects of your thought processes during your work.

>- All of the samples you present should be assembled to form one PDF file of no more than twenty (20) pages in A3 landscape format.  Arrange your sketches, drawings, photographs and films etc. on these pages. (Films should be represented in your portfolio by one image from the film and its title. The actual films are submitted as separate files.)

>- The last page must contain a table of contents covering every work in the portfolio. The table of contents should offer a clear summary of the samples of your work submitted with thumbnail images for each of them. The table of contents will be used by the selection panel to get an overview when discussing the works.
