The portfolio helps the reviewers determine your potential to perform successfully in a studio based design curriculum. In order to review each application fairly and accurately, the reviewing committee requires evidence in one or more categories.  
The level of creative skill you possess in any medium.  
The extent of your interest in the proposed degree program, made evident through your abilities in composition, physical form-making, or perception of the environment.
Your ability to translate ideas into physical form, even if in simple terms such as drawing.  
> ##### FORMAT 
- Portfolios should be designed and formatted for on-screen viewing. Maximum file size is 25 MB.
> ##### ATTRIBUTION  
- For each project, list the applicant’s name, the project’s date, and an indication as to whether the project was academic, office-related, or personal. In the case of collaborative or professional work, the contribution by the applicant must be precisely described.  
> ##### ORGANIZATION  
- The organization of the portfolio is a design exercise. It should be clear, succinct, and thoughtfully composed to best reflect your interests and skills. The quality of the work is of greater importance than quantity.
> ##### CONTENT  
- The portfolio is not expected to show interior design skills. Rather, it should contain work that demonstrates facility with a variety of media and illustrates three-dimensional understanding. You may demonstrate your creative, artistic, and perceptual skills through painting, sculpture, or other three-dimensional explorations, such as objects you have designed and/or constructed. Photography as an example of creative work must demonstrate intention in composition, color/light, or other critical point of view.
