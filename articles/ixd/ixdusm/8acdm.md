> - The design portfolio is the cornerstone of the application. The portfolio should be a curated body of work that demonstrates the applicant’s expertise in the conception and creation of sophisticated design and other relevant works (e.g., creative or critical writing, business plans, software, curriculum, research, grants, etc.).
> 
> - The portfolio must demonstrate versatility, criticality, rigor, point of view, willingness to discover, and accomplishment working with graphic, visual, interactive, spatial or experiential media. Projects can be professional, self-initiated and/or class assignments. Applicants are encouraged to include work that demonstrates process, research, experimentation and a spirit of inquiry. We encourage applicants from other fields but projects from outside of media design must demonstrate the applicant’s ability to cross boundaries and think about issues in the realm of communication and media.
> 
> - The portfolio should be edited to highlight the applicant’s best and most relevant work. Brief written descriptions of the projects should accompany each piece. Collaborative or commercial pieces should clearly state the applicant’s contribution or role.
> 
> - All projects in the portfolio should be presented through SlideRoom. No physical portfolios will be accepted.
> 
> -  Media Design Practices prefers all portfolios in the form of either a PDF or a website. The PDF or website should include stills, screen shots or photo documentation for all projects including print, interactive, motion or video. 
> 
> - Where possible, dynamic media projects should be accompanied by links to working examples to ensure the full depth of the project is experienced. This content can be on a personal website or third-party service such as Vimeo or YouTube.
