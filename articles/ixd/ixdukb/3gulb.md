> - Your portfolio should consist of original artwork and/or documentation in the form of, for example, photographs and films. Students at Goldsmiths are expected to work very independently. Your portfolio should therefore indicate not only what you have studied, but also what motivates you. 
-	You should include a range of works that show areas of independent enquiry that are emerging in your art practice. We are interested in seeing your ability to go beyond the requirements of a given brief: for example, your working process and your visual curiosity. Please only include work that is central to your practice and concerns.
-	We would also like to see an example of your written work. 
Design
-	In your portfolio you should aim to include a range of work that shows the breadth of your developing skills and interests. We are particularly keen to see your thinking through your portfolio selection and not just resolved pieces so please include examples of your process work. Where possible this work should be authentic and in the format in which it was originally generated. You might choose to demonstrate this by bringing sketchbooks in addition to your folio.
-	Whilst the BA we offer in Design is broad and interdisciplinary, we are open to seeing portfolios that may focus on a specialism or particular creative discipline as well as those which show a multidisciplinary practice. Evidence of an existing Design practice is not a requirement (e.g. in the instance that you have not had the opportunity yet to study Design) but in the absence of Design work we would like you to be able to demonstrate a reasonable understanding of the difference between disciplines. We also expect that you will have given thought to how your work may transition into a practice of Design.
-	Consider including a mixture of the following: models, 3D work, prototypes, material experiments, design sheets, sculpture, paintings, drawings, graphics, writing, illustration, typography, photography, animation, film and/or anything that you feel demonstrates your creative abilities and motivations. We're always interested to see work that is self-directed, related to outside interests or from other subjects studied (outside of Art and Design).
-	Include only work that you can talk about. We are not looking for success stories but at how you demonstrate your working process, your motivations and learning, if and how you have begun to develop your own identity through your practice. Ideally you will include at least 2-3 projects where you can talk about them from initial brief through to resolution.
-	You can send us a link to a website or alternatively we ask for a minimum of 12 key slides from your portfolio.

### 2. 马克君翻译与解读：

##### 硬性要求提取：
- 15-25 张图片（但是后续又要求20页，以20为准）
- 一个PDF 文档提交
- 接受 URL/Link 提交，推荐 Dropbox
- 20页以内的PDF，A4尺寸@72dpi
- 不能少于4个项目，其中2个必须是个人独立完成项目
- 标注清楚属性是 academic/professional/personal 即：学校作业，工作项目，个人项目
- 讲清楚自己的项目属性，与自己在项目中的参与内容

##### 软性要求解读：
- 看似内容要求很多，实际上并不是特别夸张，篇幅要求几乎是唯一的要求，严格卡在20页A4即可。综合类院校在思路上应该更严谨和完整一些。
