### 2. 马克君翻译与解读：

##### 硬性要求提取：
- 15-25 张图片（但是后续又要求20页，以20为准）
- 一个PDF 文档提交
- 接受 URL/Link 提交，推荐 Dropbox
- 20页以内的PDF，A4尺寸@72dpi
- 不能少于4个项目，其中2个必须是个人独立完成项目
- 标注清楚属性是 academic/professional/personal 即：学校作业，工作项目，个人项目
- 讲清楚自己的项目属性，与自己在项目中的参与内容

##### 软性要求解读：
- 看似内容要求很多，实际上并不是特别夸张，篇幅要求几乎是唯一的要求，严格卡在20页A4即可。综合类院校在思路上应该更严谨和完整一些。
