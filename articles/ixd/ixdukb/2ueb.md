> - Mini Portfolio
-	Applicants to Art, Design and Fine Art programmes will be asked to submit a digital mini portfolio.
-	Assessment of the mini-portfolio will form part of the selection process. Applicants applying to enter Year 2 of our programmes, who pass the first stage of selection, will be invited to bring a full portfolio to an applicant day.
-	Mini-portfolio allows applicants to Art and Design undergraduate programmes at Edinburgh College of Art to submit supplementary visual evidence to support their application(s).
How your portfolio will be assessed by the Edinburgh College of Art？
-	Your mini-portfolio will be assessed by a team of Edinburgh College of Art academic staff with professional and specialist expertise in art & design. The assessment panel are particularly interested in how applicants researched and developed their ideas in a visual way and how they engage with the visual arts and their imaginative and creative responses to ideas, to observations, to processes and to concepts. This is broken down into four main areas of assessment.
Enquiry and Visual Research
-	The level of your engagement in intelligent, structured visual enquiry and how well you communicate this.
Idea Development and Material/Technical Exploration
-	Your ability to explore and develop ideas in an appropriate way, and your level of skill in the use of materials and techniques.
Critical Judgement, Selection and Resolution
-	How well you judge which ideas have the most appropriate potential and your ability to bring them to a level of completion appropriate to your intended outcome.
Contextual Awareness
-	The extent of your knowledge of the subject you have applied for and how your work relates to it.
-	Looking at the assessment areas, your portfolio will need to include initial research/investigative work and examples of how you explore ideas, as well as examples of finished work. What form these examples might take is entirely up to you, but they must be relevant to the degree programme you are applying to. On the whole, greater emphasis is put on evidence of your visual curiosity, idea generation and exploration, and your energy, engagement and contextual awareness, than on high level technical skills and finish.
At this initial stage, the University is not necessarily expecting a showcase of final work, but rather an indication of work in progress. This must demonstrate how you approach an idea or subject and then develop the work from initial enquiry, through experimentation and enquiry, to resolved work.

### 2. 马克君翻译与解读：

##### 硬性要求提取：
- 15-25 张图片（但是后续又要求20页，以20为准）
- 一个PDF 文档提交
- 接受 URL/Link 提交，推荐 Dropbox
- 20页以内的PDF，A4尺寸@72dpi
- 不能少于4个项目，其中2个必须是个人独立完成项目
- 标注清楚属性是 academic/professional/personal 即：学校作业，工作项目，个人项目
- 讲清楚自己的项目属性，与自己在项目中的参与内容

##### 软性要求解读：
- 看似内容要求很多，实际上并不是特别夸张，篇幅要求几乎是唯一的要求，严格卡在20页A4即可。综合类院校在思路上应该更严谨和完整一些。
