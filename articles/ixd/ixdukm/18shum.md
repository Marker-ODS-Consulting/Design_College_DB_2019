> -	All applicants are expected to show us a portfolio of creative work which helps us to assess their creative and visual thinking. You normally bring the portfolio to your interview. If you are applying from another country and unable to travel to interview in the UK send us a PDF version of your portfolio or a link to your online folio.
> 
> -	Your portfolio should contain examples of design work and any other creative work which may be relevant to your application. We will be looking for evidence of professional knowledge and skills, good written and visual communication and, especially, good creative thinking evident through examples showing your design process. 
> 
> -	All work in the portfolio should have clear descriptive text saying what the images show, what was the project brief/context for the work and what were the main points you aimed to address in the work. You should also indicate when and in what circumstances the work was done for example BA, professional practice etc. Your portfolio may be reviewed in your absence so make sure your text and images tell us the project stories so we can clearly understand it.
> 
> -	We are interested to see examples of the development process that went into your work, as well as the final outcome, we will also be looking at the level of organisation and communication skill which went into preparation of the portfolio. 

**学习计划要求：**  

> -	As part of the application process we require an MA Project proposal. We want to find out what aspects of design you are interested in developing whilst on the MA. Using section 9 of the SHU application form (Further information in support of your application) please include a section that tell us about the opportunities or problems that you would like to work on and the broad context(s) that will inform your MA study. We don't expect you to have a highly developed project plan rather we want you to write approx 250 words + any relevant references. This is in addition to any other information you wish to put in section 9.
>  
> -	For example, are you interested in developing work carried out whilst on your undergraduate degree or within your professional practice? Are you looking to investigate materials or processes? Are you interested in co-design, collaborative, open or sustainable design? Is there an important problem you would like to address or are you wanting to find new ways to collaborate with business or industry? These are just a few of the possible directions MA projects might take. If you are offered a place on the course, you will fully develop your interests into an MA project proposal during your first semester of study.
