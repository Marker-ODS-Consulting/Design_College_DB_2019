The first semester consists of three taught modules that provide grounding in postgraduate study and in the techniques and theories appropriate to Interaction Design. In the second semester students will study the specialist module Design Away from the Desktop and at the same time will start the 100 credit (five modules) MRes project. The project module is studied throughout Semesters 2 and 3 (January to September), during which time students work under supervision to complete a large research-based project.
