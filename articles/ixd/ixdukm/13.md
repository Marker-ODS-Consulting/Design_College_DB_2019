**Autumn, Term One**  
The first term features a series of fast, skills-focused projects where you will be working with your peers to develop your abilities in interface prototyping, interaction design, user research and concept development.

**Spring / Summer, Term Two and three**  
In the second and third terms, you will be working with some of our external partners across a range of themes ranging from social transformation to data visualization and human-robot relations.
  
**Autumn, Term Four**  
In your final term, you will research and write your master’s thesis and develop a final major project. In parallel with this practical design work you will be evolving your critical understanding of the field, and positioning yourself relative to the main ideas and theories of interaction, cognition, and experience.
