> - Equal parts thinker and maker, Interaction Design candidates should provide at least three projects that incorporate the following:
> 
> - Projects that demonstrate interactivity and are screen-based or physical objects, or both. Each project should include a statement or explanation, sketches that show the development of your ideas, followed by a more finished rendition of your final concept.

> - Examples of screen-based projects include: mobile or social applications, web sites, gestural interfaces, and games.

> - Examples of physical projects include consumer electronics, smart products, art or environmental projects. If you have previously worked on collaborative projects that have made it to production, include a statement about your role in the design and any URLs, working versions, videos or multiple images that show how your interactive project works. Your overall goal should be to include examples of work that exhibit an understanding of—and a passion for—user experience.

> - Including your process work is an important way for you to show the development of a chosen idea and how you arrived at your solution. Process work can include: sketching, user flows, personas, wireframes and screen shots or mockups. While supporting written explanations are an essential element of your projects, your visual representations should be the primary way you express your ideas.

> - If you have no previous experience in Interaction Design, consider one or more of the following ideas for a project to include with other examples of your design work.

> - Redesign an existing web site, mobile app, or other interfaces and make it better and more user-friendly. Show the elements of your re-design through drawings, photography, photo-collage, digital images or any combination of these. Include a wireframe layout through simple line sketches.

> - Identify a particular challenge in everyday life and design an app that specifically addresses that need. Demonstrate through sketches.

> - Design the interface for a piece of hardware (electronic product) that utilizes technology or interfaces in a new and innovative way. Provide sketches and final ideas.

> - Redesign an old and obsolete consumer item using modern technology and interfaces to make it relevant for today’s world. Include an image of the original along with your sketches for the new design.

> - All applicants should feel free to include other examples of your art and design work such as drawings, graphic design or any sort of personal work.
