> -	Variety: An effective portfolio demonstrates a variety of interests, abilities and skills.  A portfolio that is well rounded, with a diversity of media and project types is stronger than one which is dominated by just one type of work.  Try to achieve a balance. 

> -	Quantity: We will review ten to twelve works. Fewer examples of work will not provide an accurate view of your experience and skills. However, do not "pad" the portfolio with more than twelve items, we will not review additional works. Select only your best examples of creative expression. 

> -	An Interest in Landscape Architecture: Your work should demonstrate an interest in the natural and built environment. An entire portfolio of skillful portraits does not necessarily reflect your interests and desire to study landscape architecture. 

> -	Organization and Order: Make sure the portfolio possesses a clear organization in which projects are thoughtfully grouped and arranged thematically. Give special attention to the sequence of the work. 

> -	Clarity, Neatness and Effective Presentation: Your potential as a landscape architecture student will be shown through the care with which the portfolio is assembled and presented. Attention should be paid to the design and composition of the portfolio itself. 

> -	Good Photographs and Reproductions: Quality work is often handicapped by poor reproductions, which make the projects difficult to see, appreciate and evaluate. Insure that your work is clearly and accurately represented. Try not to compromise your efforts with poor lighting, fuzzy focus or extraneous images in the background.
