> Applicants submit a portfolio as an uploaded attachment to the online application.

It is advised to limit the length of the portfolio to 12-24 pages (quality is better than quantity). Below are suggestions for the portfolio:

> - a) In the case of applicants with prior design experience, the Admissions Committee evaluates portfolios for evidence of conceptual reasoning, design ability, and graphic skills. Examples of work may include, but not be limited to, design documents, sketches, models, digital and hand renderings, free-hand drawing, graphic design, photographs of sculptures, and samples of writing. All work should be personal. In the case of group projects or projects carried out in an office, please clearly indicate your role in the process.

> - b) In the case of applicants without prior design experience, the admissions committee evaluates portfolios for evidence of the candidate’s potential to perform in a design program and his/her interest in the discipline. Applicants can express why they want to study landscape architecture graphically, visually, and in writing. This documentation can be recording past experiences (personal, related to school, work, or travel) through photographs, drawings and sketches, and essays. All work should be personal and original.
