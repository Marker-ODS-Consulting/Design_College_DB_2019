> Admission with No Previous Professional Education

> -	Individuals who have completed a four-year Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree, or its equivalent, with no prior degree in landscape architecture, architecture or environmental design, are eligible for admission to the program. Preference for admission is given to those who have completed a balanced undergraduate education that includes study in the arts, sciences and humanities. Applicants must document successful completion of a college-level course in the natural sciences. Preparation in the visual arts is strongly encouraged. A minimum of a one-semester, college-level course in the visual arts, such as drawing, sculpture, graphics and/or basic design, is required before beginning the first semester of study. Courses in the humanities, ecology, history of art, landscape architecture and architecture are strongly encouraged, although not required. 

> -	The portfolio submission is an opportunity for you to tell us about your creative experiences.  Candidates may demonstrate design aptitude by submitting examples of freehand drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, graphic design, furniture, product design, etc. The portfolio will help us understand your visual interests and prior experience to assist us to evaluate your aptitude for spatial thinking and design.

> Admission with Advanced Placement 

> -	Applicants who have completed a LAAB (Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board), or equivalent, degree in landscape architecture may be granted advanced placement of two semesters, subject to the review of the admission committee.  The design portfolio is a compilation of one’s own work that demonstrates the character and quality of your design background in landscape architecture or architecture. It should include studies and presentations representing your best work from past design studios, professional work, and from any other activity that has helped shape your interest for graduate study in landscape architecture.
