> - Other applicants may send us any previous visual/creative/landscape work they have done e.g. Art/design work done at school; craft/hobby outputs; photographs of garden/planting design. They should also send us some landscape drawings/images (not photographs). We suggest roughly 6 pieces of work. We recommend that you draw a landscape that evokes a strong response in you or that you are interested in. The emphasis should be on conveying the characteristics and qualities of this landscape as vividly and clearly as possible. You may use any media (pencil, charcoal, watercolour etc). We are not looking for technical competence at this stage but rather a commitment to expressing your ideas about landscape in a visual format. You may use a combination of words and text (restricted to 150 words).
