> - We ask all undergraduate applicants to submit an electronic portfolio (instructions on how to do this will be sent individually) so we can assess your visual and creative skills and potential before we make an offer. It is helpful if this includes some observational sketches as well as any other visual work you may have done.

> - If you are taking an art or design based course please include work recently completed or work in progress. We understand that some of your work may be unavailable to you due to assessment procedures, so just include what you can. We welcome Design and Technology portfolios, though it would be appreciated if you could supplement the "design research and process" work with freehand drawing from observation. This could be GCSE Art work, or you could tackle the exercise outlined below.

> - If you are not currently studying an art or design course please include examples of any creative work that you have completed recently or in the past. We especially appreciate examples of freehand observational sketching, so even if you have not had any formal training, get a pencil out and have a go! As a minimum, please try and include up to 10 drawings which explore the qualities of three places that are of interest to you, of which two should be public landscapes. We would also want you to dedicate one of your pieces to representing your street in a medium of your choice, accompanied by short piece of text (maximum 200 words) to complement it. Though they should include eye-level sketches, you may want to include observation of detail, communicating place at different seasons or times of day, annotations of how a place is used and your own reactions, use of different media if possible. If you feel you are inexperienced in drawing you may find the exercises in "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" by Betty Edwards useful.
